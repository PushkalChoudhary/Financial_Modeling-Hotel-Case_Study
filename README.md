##  Case Background
A consulting firm has been approached by a Germany-based client who intends to invest in a hotel venture in India.  
The client has completed a preliminary market and operational feasibility study and now requires an integrated financial model with six years of projections.

Key details from the client discussions include:
- **Hotel Capacity:** 200 rooms (50% Standard, 30% Deluxe, 20% Executive Suites)  
- **Project Timeline:** Construction begins Jan 2022, operations start Jan 2024  
- **CapEx:** Land purchase, construction cost of ₹750 lakh, furniture & fixtures of ₹250 lakh  
- **Financing:** 40:60 Debt-to-Equity mix, debt raised at 12% p.a., repayment begins Dec 2025 in 10 equal installments  
- **Room Tariffs:** Standard ₹4,000, Deluxe ₹6,500, Suites ₹8,500 (with annual escalation)  
- **Occupancy:** Starts lower, gradually increases until stabilizing at 60% across categories  
- **Banquet Hall:** 5 events/month, ₹5 lakh per event, prices grow 10% annually  
- **Other Revenue:** Food & Beverages = 12% of room revenue, Miscellaneous = 8% of room revenue  
- **Operating Expenses:** Benchmarked to industry averages (e.g., room expenses 18% of room revenue, utilities 5% of total revenue, management fee 9% of revenue, etc.)  
- **Tax:** 25% flat corporate tax

##  Model Structure
The financial model integrates the following:
- **Profit & Loss Statement** → Revenue, operating costs, interest, tax, and net profit  
- **Balance Sheet** → Assets, liabilities, and equity over the project life  
- **Cash Flow Statement** → Operating, investing, and financing flows  
- **Supporting Schedules** → Revenue build-up, cost schedules, depreciation, debt repayment  

---

##  Purpose
This model demonstrates how to:
- Translate **operational assumptions** (rooms, occupancy, tariffs) into financial projections  
- Assess the impact of **CapEx, financing structure, and operating costs** on profitability  
- Integrate the three statements to present a complete financial picture  
- Provide a **decision-making tool** for evaluating project feasibility
